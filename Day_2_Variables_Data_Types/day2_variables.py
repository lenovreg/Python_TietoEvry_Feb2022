# # Naming things are hard
# #Function and Variable Names
# # from https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#prescriptive-naming-conventions
# # Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
# #
# # Variable names follow the same convention as function names.
# #
# # mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that's already the prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility.
#
# bad would be to have my_name and myName in a same project
# do not make me think about it !
# # d = a # d points to the same value as a
# # print(a,d)
# #
# # a2 = 50 # we can do this but generally this smells of improvement
# # a3 = 51
# # a4 = 52 # there are better data structures
# #
# # # one of the hardest things in programming is naming variables
# #
# launch_codes_to_nuclear_weapons = "GoodBEEF" # a bit long
# # takes too long to type even on a good IDE
# # launch_codes should be better assuming your program a nuclear weapons program...
# #
# # # short variables which are fine
# # # x,y,z  would be fine when dealing with coordinates
#
# # i for iterator,
# # # t for temporary
# # # c for characters
# # # f for file
# #
# # # h for height
# # w - width would be okay
# # # l for length is a bit iffy, use of l is discouraged
# # # why? because l can be confused with 1 and I on some systems

# # # all capital variable means that it really is a constant

# # so we have str, int, and float so far
# # there is also boolean (Day 3), None -> which is specific type for representing nothing
# # then we have more complext collections

# my_str = "888.67" # this is str
# my_float = float(my_str) # this is forced type casting we want to cast our text string into a number
# my_int = int(my_float) # here I cast float to integer so naturally I lose everything after comma
#
# print(my_str, my_float, my_int)
#
# # not everthin will cast to number
# print(my_name)
# # will_fail = int(my_name) # this will fail with an ValueError # there are ways of checking
